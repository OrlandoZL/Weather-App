# Weather-App

## Description

I created this to be able to recieve information on the weather forcast for any city. It was a challenging task and I was only able to get the daily forecast and not the 5 day forecast. I used bootstrap, momentjs, jquery, javascript and much more to create this. It was a fun project although hard and the motivation was to learn to use new/different api's such as the weather api.
